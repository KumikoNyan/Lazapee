                <h1>About Us</h1>
                <p style="text-align: justify;">We are a team of three BS Management Information Systems students from Ateneo De Manila University. This page is part of our final project for our MSYS course.
        
                    As MIS students, we are passionate about using technology to solve real-world business problems. For our final project, we decided to develop a web-based system that helps small business owners manage their employees and payrolls. Our goal is to create an easy-to-use platform that allows small business owners to streamline their operations and make data-driven decisions.
                    
                    Throughout the development process, we have leveraged the skills and knowledge we have gained in our MIS classes, including database design, web development, and project management. We have also collaborated closely as a team to ensure that our system meets the needs of small business owners and provides a seamless user experience.
                    
                    Thank you for visiting our page, and we hope you find our project informative and useful. If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to contact us.</p>
